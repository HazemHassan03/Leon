A responsive landing page I developed using HTML and CSS.

The page contains 5 sections ( landing, services, portfolio, about, and contact ).

The project is 100% responsive on all devices using Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries. 

It has a button that takes you to the top of the page. 

Also, I changed the styles of the scroll bar to be suitable for the design of the page. 

A navigation bar displays when you hover on the bar icon in the header.

Add some customizations to the hovers on mobile phones. 

Make the header always fixed at the top of the page.
